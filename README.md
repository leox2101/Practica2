# Practice 2
Practice 2 Juan Diego Cortez Galvis and Leandro Cardona Mart√≠nez

This practice is developed in Prolog. We basically created a library with several cars, with characteristics such as brand, reference, price, and year. We defined rules and predicates to solve certain requirements, implementing Prolog rules and functions. This code simulates a car sales system. So basically we've created rules to generate reports, evaluate budgets and brands, the reports give us a list with the reference, price, type and year.

The generate report rule it's stated to give a list of cars that are from the same brand and type, and evaluate if the are below or equal to an individual budget, it also gives back the total price of the cars.

The budgets one is a predicate, it gives true or false depending on the price of the car, if the car price is less or equals to the stated budget gives true, if it is not, the predicate result is false.

Finally we have the brands rule, is a easy one, it makes a bag of from vehicules of the same brand. We made other functions to complement the querys and the rules.
